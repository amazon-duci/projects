2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** → Organizing scraped data into structured formats.  
3. **Exploratory Analysis** → Descriptive statistics, grouping, and trend identification.  
4. **Visualization** → Graphs and plots for price comparisons, product categories, seller activity, etc.  
5. **Insights** → Key findings, pricing trends, or consumer behavior patterns.
