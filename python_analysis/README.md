## üìù Project List

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Bank Churn** | Guided analysis of a bank churn dataset. Includes Excel dataset and a Jupyter Notebook with cleaning, visualizations, and question-driven insights. |
| **Car Sales Analysis** | Comprehensive analysis of car sales data. Includes guided questions, model building, plots, and a regression model. Due to file size, both the Excel dataset and Jupyter Notebook are provided as a ZIP. |
| **Online Retail Analysis** | Analysis of an online retail dataset with plots and insights. Includes Excel dataset and corresponding Jupyter Notebook. |
| **Webscraping** | Contains projects where datasets are scraped from **e-commerce platforms** (e.g., Jumia, Konga, AliExpress, Spar, Temu, Jiji, and others). Only Jupyter Notebooks are uploaded here since datasets are collected live. |

(More Python projects coming soon...)

## üìå Notes
- For **static datasets** (like Bank Churn, Car Sales, Retail), both the raw data and analysis notebooks are included.  
- For **webscraping projects**, only the **analysis notebooks** are provided (datasets are scraped directly online).  
- This section will expand continuously as more e-commerce platforms are scraped and analyzed.
